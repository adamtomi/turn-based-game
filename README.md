## Turn Based Game
This game was the final project for the **IITB8003-3005 Object Oriented Programming** course at Vaasa University of Applied Sciences. The game may (or may not) have been inspired by the combat system found in **South Park:
The Stick of Truth**.

> ### Requirements:
- Have a functional game
- Put some effort into it, so that it's somewhat playable
- UI doesn't matter (hence why it looks the way it does *(aka terrible)*)

> ### TODO (I'll never get around to these anyway):
- Switch to JavaFX
- Configurable logging
- Better AI
- Achievements
- Nice UI

Since the philosophy was "functionality over looks", the game works well, but is ugly *(at least the default Java Swing buttons don't look inspiring to me)*. Other than that, the game is actually playable, although saying
that it's fun to play would be a bit of an exaggeration.
